# Non-excluded Grandchild of Excluded

This grandchild page is explicitly not excluded, and neither is its parent page; but its grandparent page is excluded, so it should not appear in the navigation.

```yaml
title: Non-excluded Grandchild of Excluded
parent: Non-excluded Child
grand_parent: Excluded
nav_exclude: false
```
